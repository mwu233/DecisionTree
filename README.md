# DecisionTree
a program that builds a decision tree for categorical attributes and 2-class classification tasks.

## Introduction

**DecisionTreeImpl(DataSet train)** builds a decision tree using the training set train.

**classify(Instance instance)** predicts the given instance’s class label using the previously-built decision tree.

**rootInfoGain(DataSet train)** prints the information gain (one in each line) for all the attributes at the root based on the training set, train. The root of your tree should be stored in the member root that has been declared for you. *RootInfoGain* will only be called at the root node. It will not be called at other nodes when building your decision tree.

**printAccuracy(DataSet test)** prints the classification accuracy for the instances in the test set, test, using the previously-learned decision tree.

## Dataset
A risk loan dataset, https://bigml.com/dashboard/dataset/577bdcd477920c1ba40009a6, is to be used to predict the risk quality of a loan application. There are 1,000 noisy instances using 10 categorical attributes, divided into three files called examples1.txt, examples2.txt and examples3.txt. Each instance is classified as either good (class label G) or bad (class label B), so this is a 2-class classification problem. You can assume other datasets used for testing will also be 2-class classification tasks with categorical attributes. 

### The 10 attributes and their possible values are shown in the table below:

**A1: Checking status**

x(no checking) 
n(x<0, negative)
b(0<=x<200, bad)
g(200<=x, good)

**A2: Saving status**

n(no known savings)
b(x<100)
m(100<=x<500)
g(500<=x<=1000)
w(1000<=x)

**A3: Credit history**

a(all paid)
c(critical/other existing credit)
d(delayed previously)
e(existing paid)
n(no credits)

**A4: Housing**

r(rent)
o(own)
f(free)

**A5: Job**

h(high qualified/self-employed/management)
s(skilled)
n(unemployed)
u(unskilled)

**A6: Property magnitude**

c(car)
l(life insurance)
r(real estate)
n(no known property)

**A7: Number of dependents**

1, 2

**A8: Number of existing credits**

1, 2, 3, 4

**A9: Own telephones or not**

y(yes), n(no)

**A10: Foreign workers or not**

y(yes), n(no)

## Output:

In each file, there will be a header that gives information about the dataset; an example header and the first example in the dataset is shown below. First, there will be several lines starting with // that provide some description and comments about the dataset. Next, the line starting with %% will list all the class labels. Each line starting with ## will give the name of one attribute and all its possible values. We have written the dataset loading part for you according to this header, so do NOT change it. Following the header are the examples in the dataset, one example per line. The first example is shown below and corresponds to the feature vector (A1=x, A2=n, A3=e, A4=r, A5=h, A6=l, A7=1, A8=1, A9=y, A10=y) and its class is G. The class label for each instance is stored as a string in class DataSet.
